What's that
-----------

ist-yii-cfile is an extension for Yii Framework, bundling commonly used functions for filesystem objects (files and directories) manipulation.

This extension can also operate in standalone mode, i.e. without Yii.

    * isdir
    * isfile

    * readable
    * writeable
    * realpath
    * basename (+setter)
    * filename (+setter)
    * dirname
    * extension (+setter)
    * mimeType

    * permissions (+setter)

`Methods`
    * create
    * createdir
    * purge
    * contents
    * copy
    * rename/move
    * send/download
    * delete


Requirements
------------

    * PHP 5.1+ and Yii 1.0 or above to use as Yii extension. 
    * PHP 5.1+ to use without Yii.


Installation
------------

    * For Yii: extract extension files under `protected/extensions/file`.
    * W/o Yii: extract extension files into a directory of choise.


Usage
-----

To use with Yii Framework:

  * Introduce CFile to Yii.
  * Add definition to CWebApplication config file (main.php)

   ::

    'components'=>array(
        ...
        'file'=>array(
            'class'=>'application.extensions.file.CFile',
        ),
        ...
    ),

  * Now you can access CFile properties and methods as follows:

   ::

    $myfile = Yii::app()->file->set('files/test.txt', true);
    /*
     * We use set() method to link new CFile object to our file. First set() parameter 
     * - 'files/test.txt' - is the file path (here we supply relative path wich 
     * is automatically converted into real file path such as '/var/www/htdocs/files/test.txt'). 
     * Second set() parameter - true - tells CFile to get all file properties at the very 
     * beginning (it could be omitted if we don't need all of them).
     */

    // $myfile now contains CFile object, let's see what do we got there.

    var_dump($myfile);  // You may dump object to see all its properties,
    echo $myfile->size;  // or get property,
    $myfile->permissions = 755;  // or set property,
    $mynewfile = $myfile->copy('test2.txt');  // or manipulate file somehow, e.g. copy.

    // Please see CFile methods for actions available.

    /*
     * Now $mynewfile contains new CFile object.
     * In this example file 'test2.txt' created in the same directory as our first 'test.txt' file.
     */

    // The following is also valid.
    if (Yii::app()->file->set('files/test3.txt')->exists) {
        echo 'Bingo-bongo!';
    } else {
        echo 'No-no-no.';
    }

    /*
     * Since 0.5 you can manipulate uploaded files (through CUploadedFile Yii class).
     * 
     * Let's suppose that we have the following form in our html:
     * 
     * <form enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post">
     *   <input type="file" name="myupload"/>
     *   <input type="submit"/>
     * </form>
     * 
     * After the form is submitted we can handle uploaded file as usual.
     */
    $uploaded = Yii::app()->file->set('myupload');

    // Let's copy newly uploaded file into 'files' directory with its original name.
    $newfile = $uploaded->copy('files/' . $uploaded->basename);

    /*
     * Since 0.6 you can use Yii path aliases.
     * See http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/basics.namespace for information about path aliases.
     * 
     * Now let's get the contents of the directory where CFile resides
     * (supposing that it is in Yii extensions path in the 'file' subdirectory).
     */
    $cfileDir = Yii::app()->file->set('ext.file');
    print_r($cfileDir->contents);

    /*
     * Directory contents filtering was also introduced in 0.6.
     * 
     * Futher we get all php files from $cfileDir mentioned above.
     * We do not need all the decendants (recursion) so we supply 'false' as the first parameter
     * for getContents() method.
     * The second parameter describes filter, i.e. let me see only 'php' files.
     * You can supply an array of rules (eg. array('php', 'txt')).
     * NB: Moreover you can define perl regular expressions as rules.
     */
    print_r($cfileDir->getContents(false, 'php'));

    /*
     * Since 0.8 you can boost up file downloads.
     * Feature requires 'x-sendfile' header support from server (eg. Apache with mod_xsendfile 
     * or lighttpd).
     * If CFile::download() second parameter ('serverHandled') is set to True file download uses 
     * server internals.
     */
    $myfile->download('myfastfile.txt', true);

  * The other way to use this class is to import it into Yii:

   ::

    Yii::import('application.extensions.file.CFile');

    if (CFile::set('files/test3.txt')->exists) {
        echo 'Bingo-bongo!';
    } else {
        echo 'No-no-no.';
    }


To use without Yii simply import CFileHelper.php when needed and use CFileHelper::get() to get CFile object for a filesystem resource.

   ::

    $cf_file = CFileHelper::get('files/test.txt');  // $cf_cile now contains CFile object, use it as required.
    $cf_file->copy('mycopy.txt');
